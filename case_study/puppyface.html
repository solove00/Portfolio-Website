                    <p>Even though there are many pet services apps in the marketplace, many of the current service providers are expensive and can’t meet pet owner’s requirements for cost and service. Rover is the most significant pet boarding app right now. But many pet sitters on Rover are asking for expensive service fees regardless of their service quality. Pet service fee is much higher for holidays. Traveling out of town during holidays become more difficult when you have to consider the cost, and worry about your pet’s stay at somebody’s house. </p>

                    <p>PuppyFace solves the problems of expensive and unreliable pet services by building a credit based service exchange system between pet owners. With PuppyFace, pet owners can specify their preference for a boarding place, pet sitter’s experience, then book a service using credits (PuppyFace will give every new user ten free credits to start with). And at the same time, pet owners can also receive and check service requests from other pet owners. If the service request is accepted and finished, then the pet owner will gain credits and can be used for future pet service for his/her pets. Since the platform is not money involved and pet owners provide service to each other, PuppyFace is a more reliable and low-cost tool to find pet service. </p>

                        <li>Respondents also complained that filters didn’t allow for enough customization and that search results were overwhelming to navigate through.</li>

I completed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B57iLHS7RoSgcS1tRGhyRWtKZGs">SWOT analysis</a> of five competitors: a mix of mobile apps, mobile sites, and web sites, each claiming to help families find playgrounds around their location. Ultimately, looking at existing user reviews, testing out the apps, and examining screenshots in detail helped me identify key areas that I could build upon and improve. Most surprisingly, an app that I noted to be crudely basic was highly rated for its functional, no-nonsense utility; this was a good warning to check my biases.</p>

I returned to my SWOT analysis to assess my competitors’ approaches and tested apps from indirect competitors, including Foursquare, Hotel Tonight, and ChefsFeed. From this, I concluded that providing a delightful introduction and allowing exploration of basic features would persuade users to sign up to continue the experience with additional features.</p>

                    <p>The product’s central premise was to locate outdoor play spaces that were close by, safe, and enjoyable for children, not unlike the backyard of one’s home. The word “backyard” also came up in several conversations between parents that I witnessed which inspired this project - how, given today’s housing market, families often cannot afford homes with a yard for kids to roam and explore, but they still want to encourage their kids to play in nature and learn to socialize; or how parents often came across public playgrounds near their homes on random walks that they hadn’t realized existed there. I wanted to capture the feelings of proximity and exploration in an open, natural, familial space, and “Backyard” was thereby born.</p>
                    <p>From there, Backyard needed a logo to communicate the product’s function, key message, and personality. The logo is a simple line illustration: the leaf-cum-magnifying glass conveys the product’s simplicity with some whimsy.</p>

                    <p>I began with a pencil and paper to quickly sketch a low-fidelity prototype, focusing on providing opportunities to quickly narrow down search results and on minimizing the complexities of pinpointing family-oriented details. Rather than reinventing the wheel, I conducted multiple pattern analyses to extrapolate key elements of search, filter, view, and edit flows that met my criteria for convenience, speed, and organized simplicity.</p>
                    <p>Using paper prototypes allowed me to draw up several concept alternatives for the search, view, and edit screens, upon which I conducted basic user testing and preference tests. Feedback pointed me towards navigation and content organization as the top user priorities to keep in mind as I turned to Sketch to begin creating medium fidelity wireframes.</p>

                    <p>I wanted to test which search view users would gravitate towards, and which categories of amenities users would click through. I also wanted to see how users would navigate through the entire process from search to review. I recruited participants to be recorded in in-person usability tests as well as a video recording through TryMyUI. In-person participants were guided through a clickable InVision prototype using a test script developed from the foundations provided by Steve Krug.</p>
                    <p>Feedback generated from the tests of my grayscale prototype centered on a few key takeaways, which informed my top action items:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Refine and build filter categories into an onboarding process to highlight the product’s kid-friendly purpose;</li>
                        <li>Clarify distinction between informative and action elements on selected park screen; and</li>
                        <li>Incorporate a feed to emphasize differences between bookmarking and checking in, re-format for consistency, and make adjustments to the main navigation accordingly.</li>

                    <p>Backyard came to life as I added color and iterated on my design to create a high fidelity, clickable InVision prototype, which I then used to conduct a second round of usability testing.</p>
                    <p>Using feedback from six participants in my second round of usability tests, I refined my prototype once again:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I improved existing coach marks explaining the bookmark and add visit functions given users’ difficulties in understanding and exiting the instructive modal.</li>
                        <li>I revisited the Add a Visit flow, incorporating buttons for users to leave a review or correct information so as to highlight the calls to action and reduce barriers to completing these tasks.</li>
                        <li>Because time and accuracy were equally important to users, I overhauled the Review screen after exploring how to generate accurate ratings using yes/no questions, a checklist, or behavioral data gathered as a whole. </li>

                    <p>In creating this mobile application, I was challenged by the breadth and depth of information that users wanted for a product that would work like Google and Yelp, but better. From my research, current competitors appear to have conflicting brand identities and have not fully utilized data gathering and user testing to appeal to a broader demographic.</p>
                    <p>Working on this project also taught me the importance of organizing content to fit the needs of the specific user. Convenience and speed were real demands born out of parents’ demanding real-world needs, and every little detail that can shred seconds off completing a task is crucial.</p>
                    <p>With more time, I would continue to iterate on the user Profile screen to enable Backyard to further develop its social networking capabilities and build a foundation for potential e-commerce partnerships.</p>
